    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Welcome to Rawr.DPSWarr!

This module is designed for Warriors hoping to fulfill the DPS role in a raid, either as Fury or Arms Specialized.

To begin, assuming you have already imported your character from either Character Profiler or the WoW Armory, select your talent specialization above as either Fury or Arms if it did not do so automatically. If you would like to check your numbers against information from the next patch (at present, this is 3.2.2) you can check that item.

Next, jump over to the Fight Info Tab to set some background rules for the fight you want to measure against.
- Lag is the average Latency reported in your WoW client. Many with broadband connections usually see a value between 100 ms and 200 ms. Those with slower connection types such as dial-up will see much larger numbers.
- Reaction is the average amount of time it takes for you (the player) to react to a button that becomes available. For example, when an opponent dodges and the Overpower ability procs, how long does it take you to process this mentally and command your finger to push the hotkey for Overpower. The WoW client gives 250 ms (1/4 second) allowance for this before your reactions count against you. Most players fall under this 250 ms rule.
NOTE: Lag and Reaction are combined into a single calculable value. Small adjustments to these numbers yield *very* small adjustments in your DPS.
- The Boss Selector is a new method of using defined Presets for your 'Situational' settings. Selecting a specific boss will tailor the Duration, in back time, multiple targets etc to what is necessary for that fight. Please note that as this is a new method, many of the values for the presets still need to be fine-tuned.
- Target Level can be changed from 80 to 83. 83 is the numeric representation of all Raid Bosses (who show themselves as Level '??')
- Target Armor is currently defaulted to 10,643 for all Level 83 Bosses. This is the currently accepted rule of thumb and there is little reason to change off of this.
- Fight Duration is the length of the fight in seconds. A value of 600 is 10 minutes. Most boss fights take 6 minutes (value 360) or less but we left a high upper value for those wanting to see total damage for a greater period of time. The maximum for this box is 20 minutes, just above KT's Enrage Timer, which is a value of 1200.
- The Situational boxes provide the basic situation you will normally be fighting in. The default setting should be all disabled except 'Standing in Back' at 100%. See the Advanced Instructions (the next tab over from this one) for more info on these settings.

Finally, go to the Ability Maintenance Tab and choose the abilities you will be maintaining during your battles. Note that changing one or the other can have serious effects on your total DPS output, and some abilities act differently if you are in different situations. For example, Bladestorm will have a much larger DPS number if there are multiple targets throughout the fight.
NOTE: If you have Flooring active, turn it off unless you really want to see what it does. The methods behind it have not been refined and it is presently not as accurate as having it disabled.</value>

  <data name="RTB_Advanced.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This section is for advanced users only, most players do not need to concern themselves with these settings.

Since you have gotten your feet wet, looked at your gear, maybe even run an optimization or two, now you must be hungry for more. Fear not, there's plenty more you can tweak with your character.

The Fight Info Tab

We will be adding functionality to maintain damage taken, for survivability and for the additional rage generated from damage taken at some point, but time takes time.

The Situational Boxes on The Fight Info Tab

This tab holds information regarding how often in a fight your toon is in that particular situation. Presently, there are five options with individual settings for each:
- Standing in Back: You spend at least x% of the fight standing behind the target. Mobs are unable to parry or block attacks from behind so the ~13% of attacks that could normally be parried are no longer on the table. If you are not standing behind the mob during for any portion of the fight, Expertise will have additional value due to it preventing Parries.
- Multiple Targets: Your encounter has additional mobs within melee striking distance for x% amount of time. This provides usefulness for abilities such as Cleave, Bladestorm, Whirlwind, Sweeping Strikes to start 'doing their thing' and allowing you to hit the additional targets for a greater overall DPS. Boss fights like Patchwerk however, do not have additional targets. There is a cap for the number of targets placed so that abilities such as Whirlwind do not go for 4 targets worth of damage when there are only 2 targets.
- Moving Targets: Your encounter has a target that moves out of melee striking distance for x% amount of time. This provides usefulness for abilities such as Charge and Intercept and talents which enable these abilities. This also provides effectiveness for Move Speed Enchants like Cat's Swiftness. A good example of this situation is 'Archavon the Stone Watcher' in the 'Vault of Archavon (VoA)'. [Currently this functionality is only active for Arms, not Fury, Charge, etc abilities are not yet modeled]
- Stunning Targets: Your encounter has a target that either stuns just yourself or your entire raid  x times over the fight duration for y milliseconds (1000 = 1 second). This provides usefulness for abilities such as Every man for Himself (Humans) and the talent Iron Will. You can change the values of both boxes by changing one of them. E.g.- Set Percentage to 25% and it will change the seconds box to match and vice-versa. [Currently this functionality is only active for Arms, not Fury]
- Disarming Targets: Your encounter has a target that disarms your characters' weapon periodically in combat. This provides usefulness for things like Titanium Weapon Chain and the talent Weapon Mastery. Most bosses do not do this, but there are several groups of trash (namely in Karazhan) that will disarm players. [Currently, this functionality has not been implemented, though it will be coming soon.]
Additional Situations to manage will be coming soon.

The Ability Maintenance Tab

Select additional abilities to watch how they affect your DPS. Thunder Clap applies a debuff to bosses as do Sunder Armor, Demoralizing Shout, Shattering Throw, etc.</value>

  <data name="CK_Flooring.ToolTipText" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Flooring changes the way Rotations are calculated. Normally, an ability can have 94.7 activates in a rotation, this allows a more smooth calc for things like Haste and Expertise (due to Overpower Procs). Flooring forces any partial activate off the table, 94.7 becomes 94. This is to better simulate reality, however it isn't fully factored in everywhere that it should be.\r\n\r\nUse Flooring at your own risk.</value>
