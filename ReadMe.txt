Rawr v2.3.23.0
------------

We're pleased to announce that, after long last, Rawr3 has entered public beta. You're still welcome to continue using Rawr2 (that's what you're reading the readme for), but we urge you to try out Rawr3, and enjoy all the new features and benefits. Rawr3 is a port of Rawr to Silverlight, which means:

    - You can run Rawr3 in your web browser.
    - No need to download or install anything.
    - It runs on Mac OS X (Intel). Welcome to Rawr, Mac users!
    - You can optionally install it locally with 2 clicks from the web version, if you want to have it locally for offline use.
    - Lots more.

 So give Rawr3 a try today! Get started at:   http://elitistjerks.com/rawr.php
 Please remember that it's still a beta, though, so lots of things are likely to be buggy or incomplete!
   
   
And now back to Rawr v2.3.23.0.
 - Fix for default data of a few items.
 - Added a few buffs and reorganized the grouping of several buffs.
 - Fix for base agility on taurens being off by 1.
 - The optimizer will now consider items which have been marked available and are equippable, even if their item type is filtered out.
 - Rawr.Hunter: Fix for the ability to select Hunter's Mark. Fix for a crash with Pet buffs and talents.
 - Rawr.ShadowPriest: Fix for the bug with +hit calculations.
 - Rawr.Elemental: Fix for a bug involving DPS Fire Totems without 4T10.
 - Rawr.DPSDK: Added some ArPen-based default gemming templates. Improvements to the way the optimal rotation is detected. Fix for nested special effects producing inflated DPS. Added Resilience and Spell Penetration as optimizable stats. Fix for Cinderglacier being overvalued.

Instructions
------------
There's no installer for Rawr. Just unzip the zip anywhere you like, that you have full permissions to (that means NOT Program Files on Vista+), and run Rawr.exe. (If you have any concern about Rawr doing anything malicious, the full source code is available at http://rawr.codeplex.com/ for you to review and/or to build yourself)

Once you've got it running, you should see a basic character-screen-like layout of items. All slots will start out blank, so you can either start filling in items, or open an Armory profile. You'll probably want to open your own Armory profile, so you can get some familiar items. Goto File->Load from Armory..., and type in your character name and server (exactly, and choose a region if necessary), and hit OK. After a few sec, it should load your profile. You can mouse over an item to see the stats for it, and click on an item to get a dropdown of all of the other items available for that slot. It'll be missing your buffs, so fill those out on the main screen.

Now that you have your current character fairly well defined, use the item comparison are on the right side of the main window. You can choose a slot and a sort method at the top. The ratings calculated in this graph will update as you make changes to your gear/enchants/buffs, to always be as accurate as possible.

FAQ
---
 Q: I get an error on load, "To run this application you must first install..." or "The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000135)." How do I fix this?
 A: Install .NET Framework 3.5sp1 from Microsoft. If it still doesn't work, uninstall .NET Framework completely, reinstall .NET Framework 3.5sp1, and try Rawr again. Download link for .NET Framework 3.5sp1 from Microsoft: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=AB99342F-5D1A-413D-8319-81DA479AB0D7&displaylang=en

 Q: I get a "Cannot access disposed object." error. How can I fix that?
 A: This is a bug in an old version of the .NET Framework. Download the most recent version (3.5sp1) from the above link.

 Q: There's an item missing! Can you please add [Some Item]?
 A: No, Rawr is designed so that we wouldn't need to update it with new items every time a new item was found. You can add items to it yourself, very fast, and very easily. Look the item up on wowhead or thottbot, and remember the item ID # from the URL on wowhead or thottbot. Goto Tools > Edit Items, click Add, type that item ID # in, hit OK, and *poof*, you'll have the item. Another thing you can do, after loading your character from the Armory, is choose Tools > Load Possible Upgrades from Armory. This feature will take *a while*, like 5+ min, but will download all the items that Rawr and the Armory thinks are potential upgrades for you. It's a good idea to run this a few days after a major content patch. However, the Armory is commonly unstable immediately after a major content patch, so expect errors if you don't wait a few days.

 Q: Where can I edit the relative stat values (or weights) that Rawr uses?
 A: You can't, because Rawr doesn't use stat weights, or anything like that. See below.

Overview of Rawr
----------------
Rawr is a windows app, designed to help you create sets of gear for your WoW character. You can play with different items, enchants, and buffs, and see how they affect your stats and ratings. Based on your current stats, it will also display a graph of the value of known items for a selected slot, including multiple ratings relevant to your class/spec.

How Rawr Handles Items
----------------------
Of paramount importance in an app like this is how it handles items. Nobody wants to type in the stats of all their items, let alone the stats of all the other prospective items for each slot. If you want to customize items, or create new ones (to prepare for test server changes, for example), you still can type in stats, but you don't have to. There are two ways to load Rawr's item database with new items:

First, you can open an armory profile. Use File->Load from Armory..., type in a character name and server, and choose a region if necessary. It will load up and select all of the items used by that armory profile. Second, you can go to the item editor, choose add, and type in just the item id of an item you'd like to add. In both of these cases, the stats about each item is pulled from the Armory, so a web connection is required.

When loading a character from the armory, or starting a new blank character, be sure to go check off what buffs you typicaly raid with, to ensure you get accurate ratings.

How does Rawr work to calculate the values of items? (Or where are the relative stats setup?)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each model in Rawr has a set of calculations that returns one or more rating numbers. These numbers can be DPS/TPS/HPS/Survival/Mitigation/etc, depending on what is important to that model. To generate the charts and other calculations that you see in Rawr, it takes your race, gear, enchants, talents, glyphs, buffs, and any model-specific options, and asks the model to return ratings for your current gear with the slot you are asking about *empty*. This gives the total score for your character without that slot, which is used as a baseline. It then takes each item to be displayed in the chart, and asks the model for a new set of ratings for your character including that item. The difference between those numbers, and the baseline, is what is displayed in the graph (ie, the DPS value of an item). 

It is important to realise that every single time you see a line on any of the graphs in Rawr, that it has asked the model to calculate everything from scratch again with that complete character setup. Despite it doing so quickly, it is doing all of these calculations, and never uses any relative stat values (weights), as you may expect.

Rawr uses actual formulae to calculate your ratings; it does not use relative stats and try to multiply the stats together. Rawr is designed to be able to do these calculations quickly and efficiently. This is why the results you get in Rawr are comprehensive and far more accurate than using stats weights ever are. Stat weights are inaccurate, by their very definition, and should not be used when an accurate tool such as Rawr is available.

Rawr looks at the total stats of your character, not the stats of an individual item to measure the value. This is perhaps best explained by an example: Take the example of a DPS class and trying to calculate the graph showing helm values. (NOTE: Not actual calculations, and big round numbers are used for simplicity.)

With no helm equipped, and raid buffed, your stats are:
1000 AP, 190 hit rating (this class actually needs 200 hit rating to be capped), 10% crit, etc.
We calculate the optimal rotation to give 1000 dps, even though you're missing 2% of the time.

Now we equip Helm of Minor Hit (+10 hit rating), pushing your combined stats to:
1000 AP, 200 hit rating (at cap), 10% crit, etc.
Now we calculate the optimal rotation to give 1020 dps, with 0 misses.

Now we equip Helm of Major Hit (+20 hit rating), pushing your combined stats to:
1000 AP, 210 hit rating (over cap), 10% crit, etc.
Now we calculate the optimal rotation to still give 1020 dps, with 0 misses.

For both the 2 Helms of Hit, we calculate the difference in dps from an empty slot to be 1020 - 1000 = 20 dps. Thus both helms appear in the graph as giving 20 extra dps on top of your current equipment/buff setup.

Now we equip Helm of AP, pushing your combined stats to:
1020 AP, 190 hit rating (below cap), 10% crit, etc.
Now we calculate the optimal rotation to give 1010 dps, with 2% misses. Thus its value is shown as 10 dps.

If you then decide to replace your hit rating potion with a crit potion, your total stats while wearing each helm would again be calculated. Now that you have freed up some hit rating elsewhere, the Helm of Major Hit will be at the top of the list. The reason is that in this case you can fully use all the stats it provides. 
This same effect will be visible in the displayed value of rings (or trinket), depending on which slot is being displayed. It isn't which slot is being used, but rather the extra stats being provided by the ring (or trinket) in the other slot. For example if your 2nd ring contains a lot of crit, rings that contain a lot of AP might complement it better and appear high in the list for ring 1. If you look at the list for ring 2, the ring with the highest crit is likely to be on top. 

An important thing to realize is that we never decide that a stat like hit rating has a relative weight compared to AP and then tried to calculate the score for an item using that weight and the stats of the item (that type of approach is used by many in-game addons but is extremely inaccurate when dealing with capped stats). We simply compare DPS numbers while wearing each possible item. Using this combined stats approach we handle all capping effects.

Frequently, questions are posted on the discussion forums asking how relative weights can be adjusted. There is no way to adjust this, because there are no relative weights to adjust. Relative stats weights are a quick way to judge gear you can use on the day of hitting 80, when you're still far from any of the caps. But after being in more than a handful of heroics, it just becomes too unreliable to use on any stat that has a cap (i.e. expertise, hit, haste, armor penetration, armor and possibly even mana regen).

Rawr on Mac OS X / Linux
------------------------
NOTE: Rawr v3 is currently in development, and will run natively on OSX Intel. Contact me (WarcraftRawr@gmail.com) if you're interested in beta testing it. Until then, I can't offer any support for running it as describe here, (though it does work for many people):

You can run Rawr using Mono. Mono is a set of libraries that mimic the .NET Framework, which Rawr is built on, allowing it to run on OSX (and Linux). However, unfortunately, it's extremely buggy. If you want to give it a try, please do, it very well may work just fine for you. For most users, running Rawr via some form of emulation (Boot Camp, VMWare Fusion, Parallels, etc) will give you the best results, though. 

That said, I'm doing what I can to make Rawr available to Mac users, and that means officially supporting running Rawr on OSX, via Mono. 

How to Run Rawr on OSX:
 1) Install Mono (http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html) for Mac OS X. 
    1a) NOTE: At time of writing, Mono v2.4 is the latest, however, it's broken; use Mono v2.2 if you have issues with the latest version.
 2) Unzip Rawr. 
 3) Open the Terminal, navigate to where you unzipped Rawr (look for basic guides to the Terminal, if you need help with that), and type 'mono Rawr.exe', and hit enter. That should launch Rawr for you. 
 
Mono has some problems, so I appreciate your patience as I work to try to make Rawr stable under Mono. I strongly suggest saving often for now.

Known Issues:
 - Mono doesn't look perfect. It looks kinda ugly, and you'll see some weird graphical artifacts. I'll try to work around this as best I can, but it's going to take time.
 - Mono has some crashing problems. Things will be running fine, then all of a sudden, the whole app'll close. I can try to work around these bugs in Mono, but it's going to take time. 
 - Tooltips on labels don't work in Mono. I'll see if I can work around this for a later version. At least for stats, you can work around this by using the Copy Character Stats to Clipboard feature.
 - The clipboard doesn't work under Mono. In the mean time, when running on Mono, Copy Character Stats to Clipboard will save the stats as 'stats.txt' in the folder with Rawr.
 - More issues, I'm sure.

 As you can see, we still have alot of work ahead of us, but we're actively working on it. If you are an experienced C# dev, a knowledgable theorycrafter, and would like to help out, especially with the models which we haven't begun updating for 3.0, please contact me at WarcraftRawr@gmail.com. Thanks, and look forward to frequent updates!

v2.1.9:
    Rawr is now accepting donations. Please use Tools > Donate, or goto https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=2451163 if you'd like to donate, to help accelerate the development of Rawr and its models. Thank you!
    Updated parsing for a large number of trinkets/gems whose wording changed in WoW 3.0.8.
    Support for (or more accurate support for) a variety of additional trinkets, in many models.
    Fixed the data for a few profession bonuses which changed.
    Updated the tooltips on all talents.
    Tweaked the Relative Stat Values chart a bit to avoid some anomalies with rounding and stats which provide multiple benefits (ie, both Crit and AP from Agi for Cats).
    Rawr.Cat/Bear: Fix for crit chance reduction against bosses, and fix for display of crit chance debuffs.
    Rawr.Tree: Fixes for haste calculations
    Rawr.Mage: Updates for WoW 3.0.8/hotfix changes. Added Scaling vs Spirit chart.
    Rawr.RestoSham: Support for some glyphs, and more customizable healing rotations. Also enabled cloth/leather.
    Rawr.ProtWarr: Major updates. Threat should be accurate, and a variety of minor fixes and additional options
    Rawr.TankDK/DPSDK: Updated for 3.0.8 changes. A wide variety of major fixes and improvements.
    Rawr.HealPriest/ShadowPriest: Added optimizable values that you can create requirements for, or optimize for.
    Rawr.Elemental: Initial release. Not fully complete yet, but included in this release of Rawr so that you can see how we're progressing. We still advise using Rawr.Elemental in conjunction with other theorycrafting tools.

v2.1.8:
    Fixed a bug in the Optimizer that would stop it from equipping the optimized gearset when any item gemmings to be equipped weren't in the itemcache already.
    Fixed several bugs with Wowhead parsing, and updated the default itemcache with the new 3.0.8 data from Wowhead.
    Added the two new enchants from 3.0.8.
    Rawr.Healadin: Removed profession benefits from Options since they are now all correctly modelled in there respective places. Support for Judgements missing, and effect of Hit rating. Fixed bug that capped HL too high incorrectly. Added support for FoL Glyph. Updated 2T6 and 4T6 bonuses.
    Rawr.HealPriest: Raid & CoH spam rotation changes for 3.0.8. Major tweak in Holy/Disc Priest mana consumption, should now actually become saturated at a point. Fiddled more with Trinkets.
    Rawr.Tankadin: Adjusted calculations for new Sacred Duty.
    Rawr.Retribution: Fix for loading the saved glyphs.
    Rawr.Tree: New custom chart for Spell Rotations. New feature to choose the ratio of burst vs sustained healing used in Overall ratings. 
    Rawr.Mage: Added Arcane Scorch cycles.
    Rawr.Cat: Added 4T7 calculations.
    Rawr.ProtWarr: Tweak to the Vitality calculations to match WoW's rounding.
    
v2.1.7:
    All models now contain a Relative Stat Values chart, which dynamically shows the value of various common stats to your current character. Some models had charts similar to this, and most of those still remain, in case they show any additional stats that this universal chart doesn't, but they will be removed in the next major version. As before, remember that these are only outputs from Rawr's calculations, not used internally by Rawr. Also, still remember that they will never be 100% accurate, and to always update whatever you use them for, whenver your gear/enchant/buffs change, in order to maintain as close to accurate as you can.
    Fixed a couple more bugs with Wowhead parsing, and made it more resilient to errors (won't break your whole item cache update if it does hit an error).
    Fixed a bug that would clear your available items on reload character from Armory.
    You can now create filters that apply only to gems, or only to gear. (Not used by default filters yet, though)
    Added support for several more trinket proc/effects.
    Equipped items will always be shown in item listings, even if they would otherwise be filtered out.
    Equipped items will now be marked as available, when re/loading from the Armory
    Rawr.Cat/Bear: Adjusted calculations for the new FeralAP system. Weapon DPS is now counted as attack power, and items no longer show innate feral attack power. I've manually updated all feral weapons to have their new DPS values, but the actual stats on the items are still from 3.0.3 (ie, there's still Str on them, instead of plain AP). Please refresh the data on these items, once Wowhead/Armory update to 3.0.8.
    Rawr.Tree: Major improvements all around. Still not fully complete.
    Rawr.RestoSham: Major improvements all around. Still not fully complete.

    Rawr.DPSWarr: Initial draft of 3.0 version. Not fully complete yet, but included in this release of Rawr so that you can see how we're progressing. We still advise using Rawr.DPSWarr in conjunction with other theorycrafting tools.
    Rawr.TankDK: Fixed expertise calculations.
    Rawr.Rogue/Warlock: Nothing new, yet, but wanted to mention that we have a ton of active development on these models lately, and new versions are coming soon.

    Items now show their item level in their tooltips. 
    Armor and Bonus Armor are now handled separately. 
    Performance and crash fixes to the Optimizer. 
    Added mousewheel support for the charts. 
    Added buffs for Mixology. 
    Added support for Blacksmithing sockets (reload character from armory, or load character from 2.1.4 and remove extra gem from items). 
    Added a context menu item to quickly evaluate the upgrade value of the clicked item.
    Added support for updating the entire item cache from Wowhead.

    Rawr.ProtWarr: Adjusted miss rate from 9% to 8%, and dodge rate from 6.5% to 6.4%.
    Rawr.ShadowPriest Added Arcane Torrent for blood elves. Fixed display issue with Misery/Faerie Fire hit. Support for more trinket effects. Support for more set bonuses.
    Rawr.Tankadin: Fix for block rating conversion.
    Rawr.DPSDK: Fixes for a few calculations. Fixes for item relevancy to show DK set items, not paladin ones.
    Rawr.RestoSham: Updated a variety of calculations. Not fully updated yet, but included in this release of Rawr so that you can see how we're progressing. We still advise using Rawr.RestoSham in conjunction with other theorycrafting tools.
    Rawr.Enhance: Updated the default and available target levels from 70-73 to 80-83, and raised the maximum target armor.
        
        
v2.1.4: Added tracking of item levels, and filtering by item level and a few other item properties. Added support for several additional buffs and enchants. Fixed Wowhead and Armory parsing for a few stats. Fixed CharacterProfiler support. ShadowPriest: Fixes for Optimization, and support for a few more buffs.

Tree: Fixed haste and crit calculations. Cat: Adjusted base miss rate to 8%, added support for total % damage increases. Bear: Fixed a minor bug in DR calculations.

Support for several new set bonuses and proc/use effects. Fixed base stat calculations in Retribution and Tankadin, and a few more calculation fixes in Retribution. Fixes for a few buff/enchant stats.

v2.1.2: Improvements to launch time, and item editor performance. Support for more set bonuses and abnormal item stats. Fix for crash in Priest models. Updates to base stats and rating conversions for several models. Fixes for requirements and optimization of several gems. Added ghost hit for Frostfire bolt in Mage. Fixed the formula for PW: Shield in HealPriest. Improved calculations for Cat and Bear, and made Cat results more descriptive.

v2.1.1: Improved calculations for level 80 combat for several models (Cat, Bear, HealPriest, ShadowPriest, Mage, Moonkin, Tree, Healadin). Added Leatherworking and Inscription self-enchants. Fixed some bugs with mass gem replacement and the optimizer.

v2.1: Updated for level 80 content. Removed models which haven't yet been updated for WoW 3.0. Added two brand new models: Enhance and DPSDK! Welcome to Rawr, Enhancement Shamans and DPS Death Knights!

v2.0.0
 - First release version targeting WoW 3.0

Beta 16.1:
 - The beginnings of user-controlled item filtering is in. Let me stress that this is just the beginning.

In the future, we expect to expand upon this greatly, by allowing all kinds of filters (such as by source, by item level, etc), and will be making the UI to control this more intuitive.

   - Fixed crit reduction not taking talents into account.

 - Mac support! See the readme for details.
 - Major improvements to the intelligence of the Optimizer
 - Added a new feature in the Optimizer: Build Upgrade List.

 - Rawr now correctly handles mainhand and offhand enchants, as appropriate by equipped items.
 - Improved the loading performance of the Item Editor on successive loads. The first time you open it, it should be faster than before, and the second+ time should be nearly instant.
 - Fixed a bug that made the Fill Sockets functionality of the Item Editor not work.
 - Fixed a bug that made the chart render as a big red X occasionally.
 - Made some changes that may help with the UI for users of high-DPI resolutions. High DPI is still not supported (as Windows' support for it is retard and broken), but this should help somewhat.
 - Fixed a leak of control handles in the item selector, should improve performance and prevent crashes related to this.
 - Fixed the Armor Penetration values of Imp/Expose Armor.
 - Reloading the current character from the armory will now load enchants and talents, in addition to items.

 - Added support for loading characters from KR and TW realms.

 - Rawr.Bear changes:
    - Added Threat rating
    - Made the Defense Rating to Defense Skill conversion stepwise, so that partial Defense Skill don't count. Adjusted the amount needed to be uncrittable to match (previously, Rawr.Bear may have told you that you'd need 1def rating more than you really did, that's fixed by this).

 - Fix for Rawr.Mage requiring .NET 3.5.

Beta 13:
 - Rawr now includes a Retribution model, built by Anarkii! Since it's our first Ret release, it may have some bugs, so please report anything you find wrong with it, and welcome to Rawr, Retadins!
 - Added an Optimizer feature. The Optimizer works by looking at different combinations of gear that you have available (mark items as available by clicking the diamond next to the item in the charts), and finding the best possible set of gear. There's lots to see in the Optimizer, so give it a try, and let us know how it works. One known issue with the optimizer: Unique gems may be used multiple times; best to just not mark any unique gems as Available for now.
 - Added a Status dialog that will show the status of all pending network operations (like loading items from the Armory). Note that there's still no way to cancel these operations while they're in-progress, but we hope to have that in a future update, soon.
 - Improved the performance of loading and saving cached items, and performing some common item stat calculations, and fixed several bugs with the item editor.
 - Items with class restrictions will not show up for other classes.
 - Items will now display a Location, of where to get them. The data for this is still vague or non-existent in some cases, since it's loaded from the Armory, but for the most part it should be useful.
 - All DPS models' DPS rating is calculated in terms of plain DPS (as opposed to DPS*100);
 - Downloads from the Armory should be more resilient now, retrying whenever random failures occur, and correctly supporting more types of proxy servers where needed.
 - The current character name and filename will appear in the title bar.
 - Tooltips are now shown for buffs on the buff selection tab.
 - Buffs and Enchants will now combine the built-in lists with what's in your itemcache, so that you can preserve customizations between versions.
 - Rawr.Bear: Added all missing 2.4 items/enchants to the default ItemCache, resist enchants are now correctly counted, there are now debuffs for Sunwell Radiance and mobs that don't crush.
 - Rawr.Mage: Added more AB-AM cycles, now shows a tradeoff coefficient for all spells, improved rotation and trinket optimization, improved performance, now tracks threat, auto selects Mage/Molten armor,
 - Rawr.Moonkin: Removed the Mana Efficiency rating, since it was already contained in the total damage rating, improved the accuracy of several calculations, added set bonuses, updated mechanics for 2.4, now shows several different damage-related calculations similar to the spreadsheet.

Beta 12.1:
 - Fixed a bug that would cause "Input string not in correct format" errors when Rawr was run on copies of Windows for a region where a period is not the decimal separator (ie european countries where it would be "1,23" instead of "1.23").
 - For proxies that filter by user-agent, the user-agent used by Rawr is now customizable in the proxy options.
 - Config settings (like recent files) are now user specific.
 - Fix for occasionally not loading icons immediately even though a network connection is available. Also fixed an error when there was no network connection.
 - Rawr.Mage: Added new AB-AM cycle and new AB cycles with Frostbolt/Scorch filler, added a fix for the item budget comparison, added scrolling on the options screen, added Drums of Battle stacking, 
 - Rawr.Warlock: Fixed issue when altering spell cycle
 
Beta 12:
 - Rawr now includes models for Moonkins, Mages, and Warlocks!
 - Many more stats are tracked about items, for use in new and upcoming models.
 - Fixed a bug in the options for Cat, so that it updates the label for the value of expose weakness.
 - Icons now pull from the more reliable wowarmory.com instead of the old flakey armory.worldofwarcraft.com.
 - You can now safely run multiple copies of Rawr at the same time by duplicating Rawr's folder. Each running copy of Rawr must be in its own folder, with its own cache xml files.
 - Fixed some bugs that would cause Rawr to crash.
 - The Splash screen has finally been redone! It now has a background image, and an icon for each model that is loaded, along with the version #s of each model, Rawr's UI, and Base.
 - Tooltips on the calculations should really last a long time now, for everyone, I hope.
 - The ItemCache should save faster, load faster, and take up alot less space, per item.
 - There's a menu item now, to reload the character data from the Armory for the current character.
 - The Projectile and Projectile Bag slots will now be hidden if they don't apply to the current model.
 - Improved how Rawr handles requests for data from the Armory.
 - When unable to access the Armory will now handle it much more gracefully. If you see blank icons, anywhere, that's probably the case.
 - There's now an options dialog. More will come in there, but for now, there's customizable proxy settings. If you were previously unable to use Rawr due to being behind a proxy that was different from your IE settings, or required different authentication, give this a try.

Beta 11:
 - You can now change between Bear and Cat mode, and any other models, on the fly, using the new Model menu.
 - All stats are now editable in the Item Editor, not just bear stats.
 - Rawr has been updated for the 2.4 PTR, as of 2/15. Most of the new items have been added, and the idols have been changed to their new stats. Note that you shouldn't try to Refresh Item Data on a new item, as it'll just fail to find the item and timeout.
 - Added accurate calculations for all the decent cat idols.
 - There's now a checkbox on the Options tab to enable Metagem requirement detection. If you run into a situation where one item is ranked higher than another, and you think it should be the other way around, see if the first one helps you meet the metagem requirements, and the second one doesn't. Turn that option off if you like handling metagem requirements yourself, and it'll always count the metagem.
 - Buffs now have tooltips in the charts.
 - The most recently used model will be selected at startup. No more dialog asking what model you want to startup in.
 - There's now a list of recently opened files in the File menu, so you can open your different gear sets and characters faster.
 - The model system has been changed so that each model is its own DLL, meaning that models can be updated/added/removed seperately of Rawr itself.
 - Fixed a few bugs on dual-monitor setups.
 - Items can now have weapon properties (min/max damage, speed)
 - In order to prepare Rawr for a wider variety of models, the item type/slot system has been revamped. You'll now notice that there are 2 more buttons on the main form, for Projectile and Projectile Bag, though nothing will fit in them for ferals. Same with the offhand.
 - Added support for all races, though Rawr.Cat and Rawr.Bear only have stats for NE/Tauren, of course. This is in preparation for Rawr being used by other classes.
 - Items with no stats relevant to the current model will be hidden from charts/dropdowns
 - There are now several new buffs for cats: ExposeWeakness (which has a slider on the Options tab to control its AP value), and Bloodlust, Drums of Battle, and Drums of War (which have sliders on the Options tab to control their uptime %).
 - Models can now define their own custom charts, which are now used by Cat to include Combat Table (White), Combat Table (Yellow) and Relative Stat Values, and by Bear to include Combat Table and Relative Stat Values. Note that due to rounding abormalities when working with small values of certain stats that get multiplies, the two Relative Stat Values charts aren't as informative as I'd like, yet; take their values with a large grain of salt, consider them alpha quality for now.
 - You can resize the main form to give you more chart space, and more space for the tab control with calculation display, buffs, options, enchants.

Beta 10:
 - Cat Support! When Rawr opens, you'll be given a choice of loading the Bear of Cat calculation model. Choose Cat to start using Rawr for optimizing your dps! Most of the Cat calculations are based on Toskk's cat calculator. Huge thanks to Toskk for this!
 - Rawr automatically will detect and activate set bonuses as appropriate.
 - Cat stats are now loaded from the armory, in addition to Bear stats. Only stats relevant to your current mode will be visible.
 - Procs and Uses are now averaged out for Cat, but remain off with optional buffs for Bear.
 - The calculation models are now completely modular. Rawr is very extensible now. It will be much easier to add another model now. If anyone's interested in writing Rawr.Tree, or Rawr.Moonkin, or Rawr.Afflliction, or Rawr.Mutilation or any other class/spec, let me know.
 - There's now an Options tab which contains additional options for the calculations, for both Cat and Bear. For Bear, there's only Target Level. There's much more for Cat though (although most of the Cat options aren't done yet). Currently you can change the Target Armor and choose how often you Powershift.
 - The legend on the comparison graph is gone. I hope to re-implement that at some point, but not a high priority.
 - Improved rendering of tooltips slightly.
 - Fixed a bug with the Filter box on the Item Editor.
 - Probably a dozen other little things that I can't remember cause I've been working on this for so long.
 

Beta 9a:
 - Fixed a bug that made the new tooltips disappear really fast
 - Fixed a bug that made Load Upgrades From Armory skip waist items
 - Added better error messages for all Armory interactions, to indicate whether or not any response was received at all, what that response was, and if no response was received, that you should check your firewall/proxy settings first.

Beta 9:
 - Fixed several crashing bugs introduced in Beta 8
 - Buffs and Enchants are now dynamically loaded from xml files in the Rawr folder. While there is no way to edit them in Rawr, yet, you can at least edit buffs and enchants now, by editing the BuffCache.xml and EnchantCache.xml files, and relaunching Rawr.
 - Added mouseovers giving more info for Overall/Mitigation/Survival Points, and Armor Mitigation value.
 - Minor bugfixes and code cleanups in preparation for generalizing Rawr so that many modules can be made, like Rawr.Cat for kitties.

Beta 8:
 - Rawr now records and displays item quality (rare, epic, etc). If you reuse your ItemCache.xml from a previous version, you'll need to refresh the item data for each item you want to see the quality of. Thanks to Wicks for this functionality!
 - Added support for Finger enchants.
 - Gems in the comparison graph now show up highlighted in their color.
 - Left clicking on an item in the comparison graph will popup the context menu for it, not just right clicking.
 - When loading items from the Armory, Rawr will now retry 3 times if it fails. This should solve the errors caused by intermittant Armory problems. Additionally, if it still fails, it won't close Rawr.
 - Fixed some display problems in the item editor. Also, if you add an item with an ID that doesn't exist, it'll offer to create the item as a blank item, for you to fill in.
 - Clarified the tooltip for anticrit when you're uncrittable. (Defense over the cap isn't totally wasted)
 - Attempting to refresh the data of an item with an item id that doesn't really exist will no longer delete that item. It will alert you to the fact that it could not find item data for that item, and revert to the current data.

Beta 7:
 -Added Contextual Menus for items. You can now right click on an item on the main screen, in the popup item selector, to get a menu of things to do on that item:
    -Edit: Opens the item editor to that item.
    -Open in Wowhead: Opens a new web browser window and navigates to the item in wowhead.
    -Refresh Item Data: Refreshes the data about the item from the armory.
    -Equip: Equips the item.
    -Delete: Deletes the item from Rawr's database.
 -Implemented a ton of new temporary buffs. These buffs are typically from trinkets, or other procs, and most can't really be relied upon to base your gear selections around, but it is interesting to see your stats with these activated.
 -There are now 3 different buff comparison graphs, which let you choose which subset of all the buffs to show: All Buffs, All Long-Duration Buffs (No Dual Wield), and Current Buffs.
 -Made the buff selection tab less cramped, by splitting it into categories, and making it scroll.
 -Added a tooltip to the Chance to be Crit % on the main screen, which will display how much you're over, or under the anti-crit cap, in terms of defense rating or resilience.
 -Added a comparison graph for the Combat Table. This will display the chances of each possible combat swing outcome. If you sort by alphabetical, it will be displayed in the correct order of the combat table.
 -Added another comparison graph, which will include all of your currently equipped gear, enchants, and buffs. While not particularly useful in making gear decisions, this is interesting to look at to see where your mitigation and survival come from.
 -May have fixed the problem with tooltips appearing in the wrong spot on computers with multiple monitors.
 -Enchants in the comparison graph will be highlighted if they are the currently selected enchant for that slot.
 -Buffs will now be highlighted in the comparison graph if they are active.
 -Tooltips will now show up for enchants in the comparison graph.
 -Added a Filter box on the item editor, to make finding specific items in the list faster.
 -Fixed a bug where resilience rating wasn't properly detected on items in a few cases, mostly on gems or socket bonuses.
 -Made the comparison graph understand the concept of 'Infinity'. It will no longer bug out and be blank if any item has a mitigation or overall rating of infinity. This can occur when an item pushes you over 100% dodge.
 -Capped dodge at 100-Miss. Functionally, this doesn't really matter, since it doesn't matter how much over 100% your Miss+Dodge is, if it is over 100%, but I made the change so that it the actual chances of each occurance are correct.
 -Fixed the tab order on the item editor.
 -Fixed some display issues with item tooltip content.
 -Cleaned up the code all over the place.
 -Minor bugfixes here and there.

Beta 6a:
 -Fix for editing gems

Beta 6: (private release)
 -Updated a few buffs for Patch 2.2
 -Implemented new ToolTips for items. While not a highly requested change (and functionally there have been no changes), it was necessary in order to implement the next item...
 -Implemented new item selection dropdowns. Instead of clicking on an item slot and getting a dropdown menu, there's now a much more feature rich popup to choose items. I fully intend to flesh this out with more features, but for now you can see what gems are in each item, see the tooltip for it, see the ratings for it, and have the list sorted by ratings/alpha. You can also type a part of the item name in the Filter box, to filter to items containing that text.
 -Added Alphabetical sorting to the graph
 -Fixed a nasty bug with the calculations for Blessing of Kings. Sorry about that. :(
 -Ugh, prolly a few other things I can't remember right now since it's been so long.

Beta 5a:
 -Fix for the Back slot being broken. Oops.

Beta 5:
 -Finally fixed the bug that made items come back after you delete them. Big thanks to Imagy for help with this one. This also happened to fix the bug that prevented you from adding a second copy of an item that you already have an ungemmed copy of.
 -Implemented Sardrimm's calculations for agi and sta to make Rawr calculate your agi and sta from gear even more accurately. Should be exactly correct 95% of the time now, and only off by 1 otherwise.
 -Made the Name/Realm/Region of a character exposed and editable on the main screen.
 -Added a "Load Possible Upgrades from Armory" feature. Character Name/Realm/Region are required to use this feature. Choose Tools > Load Possible Upgrades from Armory, and the loading screen will come back up and Rawr will think for a while. Quite a while, actually. You might want to go get a sandwich or something, it can take like 5+ minutes. If you think it's hung and it's not doing anything, it is, just let it think for a while longer. :)  Eventually, it'll finish downloading and processing a ton of data from the Armory, and *poof*, your dataset will be filled with a multitude of potential upgrades for every slot. I say potential because not all items it finds will be upgrades. Specifically, it will download all items that the Armory suggests as upgrades (see the Find an Upgrade feature in the Armory), fill it with the best gems you know about for the gem slot color, and run Rawr's calculations on it, and save it if its overall rating is at least 80% of your current item's overall rating. 
 -Made Rawr detect whether a copy of Rawr is already running when it launches, and not launch if there's already a copy open. This will prevent all those errors where it doesn't look like it's loading, and a user tries to launch it again.
 -Added some code that should detect when you're behind a proxy server that requires authentication, and pass your default credentials to it if needed. I have no way to test this, so if you've previously reported a Proxy Requires Authentication error to me, please give Beta 5 a try, and let me know if it works for you.
 -Added a FAQ to the readme.
 -Fixed a bug that prevented Rawr from properly detecting Socket Bonuses of resilience.
 -Made a few error messages more user friendly, and describe how to fix it.

Beta 4b:
 -Updated to use the new armory domains, www.wowarmory.com and eu.wowarmory.com. Won't matter unless you want to armory a character on a realm with a space in its name (gg armory redirect double-encoding).

Beta 4a:
 -Fixed a bug with rating calculations for improvable buffs

Beta 4:
 -All calculations in Rawr should be almost perfectly accurate, with 2 exceptions. I haven't gotten the chance to implement the logic to predict how WoW rounds Stamina and Agility, so these numbers may be off by 1, and any calculations based off those may be off by the value of 1 sta/agi. If anyone finds any occurrances of calculations being off by more than this, PLEASE let me know.
 -One calculation change was significant, so I wanted to call it out specifically. The Total Damage Taken calculation (and subsequently Mitigation Points), did not account for crushing blows or crits. Now it does. For example, if in some hypothetical situation, you had 85% dodge+miss, and 0 armor, you'd receive 15% of the mob's attacks, but they'd all be crushes. Previously, Rawr would consider that as 15% of total damage taken. Now it accounts for those being crushes, so it more accurately says that you'll take 22.5% of the raw incoming damage. Compared to the previous version, the value of agility increases slower as you gain agility, until you reach 85% dodge+miss, then the rate of increase goes way up. In practical terms, you'll see your damage taken score go up from the previous version.
 -I tweaked the scale of Mitigation Points a bit, to make it more even with Survival Points. See my post in the US Druid forums, "Theorycrafting: Method for Rating Bear Gear", for details.
 -The Comparison graph now has slot choices for each Enchant slot, and for Buffs. Can't decide between 6stats and 150hp? Or between 4stats and 12sta? A flask or two elixirs? And which elixirs? Check out the graphs!
 -Rawr will now create a Rawr.log file in the same folder as itself. When Rawr is closed, it will write a log of what you loaded from the armory, and *why*. This will help me track down problems where items get deleted, then magically reappear.
 -Massively improved the performance of the calculations. Depending on the calculations being performed, you should experience a big difference. Calculations should go at least 1.4 times faster, most likely 30-40 times faster, even up to 80 times faster in some cases. You probably won't even notice calculation lag anymore.
 -Rawr's 'HossPoints' really are quite different from the overall points that Hugehoss used in his spreadsheet, so to avoid confusion, I've renamed it to Overall Points.
 -Added Elixir of Mastery. Useful in some situations.
 -Added Major Armor to cloak enchant. No, you shouldn't be using this, but I included it so that you could see on the graph just how bad it is, compared to 12agi. The only time 120armor is more valuable than 12agi is when you're mostly naked. I also included Dodge to cloak, so you can see that there's never a time when it's better than 12agi, in any way. 
 -Added a giant sign with huge red letters that [almost] pops out of your monitor and slaps Emposter in the face.
 -Fixed a bug with meta gems being put in meta slots, and completing socket bonuses
 -Added a "Copy Character Stats To Clipboard" item in the Tools menu, which will copy the calcualted character stats, so that you can post it on forums, or save a history of your stats in a text file or something.
 -Added a Mit/Surv legend to the graph
 -Removed the racial base dodge rating from what shows up in the character stats, to avoid confusion. Now you'll just see the dodge rating from gear, just like in WoW
 -Added a Duplicate button on the Item Editor, which will duplicate the currently selected item.
 -More minor bugs, features, and tweaks, that I've probably missed or just forgotten I added. :)

Beta 3:
 -Characters saved with Beta 2 will not be compatible with this version, so please start from loading your armory again.
 -Massively improved the armory loader, to load enchants by IDs, correctly detect which gems you have and download data for those gems, rather than creating a new gem with the detected stats of the gems you're wearing.
 -All character/item/gem/image data is downloaded from the Armory now, rather than partially from the Armory, partially from Allakhazam, and partially made up from scratch.
 -The Gem Editor has been merged into the Item Editor. Gems now appear as their own heading in the list on the left, and there is a new item in the Slot dropdown for each gem color. When you hit Add Item, and type in the ID of a gem, it will not properly download all the stats and data about that gem, unlike before.
 -The Item Comparison graph on the right side of the main window has had some improvements. Mousing over an item name will now display the tooltip for that item, so that you can now distiguish which gem selection it is. Additionally, the currently equipped item is highlighted in green. There are now two new items in the Slot dropdown, Gems and Metas, which display the regular gems and meta gems in your dataset. While ratings for normal items are calculated by taking the difference between the overall ratings of your character with that item equipped, and with that slot empty, calculatings for gems are the difference between your current character ratings, and your character ratings if you had a buff with the stats of that gem.
 -Added the Elixir of Major Fortitude as a potential buff.
 -Fixed a multitude of crashing bugs and made many minor fixes/improvements.

Beta 2b:
 -Fixed a bug where, when loading an armory, items that Rawr had not seen before would be loaded with their sockets empty, instead of whatever gems you have.

Beta 2a:
 -Fixed a bug in how Rawr adds new gems to its library when it first sees them, that would hang your machine. Sorry!
 
Beta 2:
 -Initial Public Release
