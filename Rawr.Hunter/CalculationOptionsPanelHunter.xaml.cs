PNStuff.Add(
"v2.3.2 (Dec 12, 2009 14:39)",
@"- Corrected the pet talent descriptions called in the pet talents comparison chart (was possible to call the incorrect rank's info)
- Added a couple of missing Special Effect Triggers to Relevancy
- Renamed the Set Bonuses to include '(T?)' where ? is the Tier number
- Reworked the T9 4P to use new Stat PetAttackPower
- Added Survivability to Hunter, This is separated for Hunter and Pet and can be Scaled/Weighted from 0.0 to 10.0 (default 1.0). This includes simple things that improve survivability like reduced damage taken, or ability heals that occur on self, and healing potions, etc
- Added Pet Dodge Percentage to the Stats Pane so users can see when their pet is getting dodged (due to the Hunter lacking Hit)
- Fixed a typo in the tooltip for the Rabid pet talent
- Heavy Reworking of the Pet Stats, these need to be stabilized a bit but the end-result is a much more accurate depiction of Pet Stats instead of the really weird way they were being done before.
- Added a new series of gemming templates
- Adjusted the special effects formula with regard to pet attacks and steady shot hit intervals
- Fixed a bug with Hit Rating not getting full value (I had revered teh anti-dodge handling for pets)
- Fixed Attack Power usage on Hunter & Pet (was migrating it all to AttackPower stat but shots n stuff were using RangedAttackPower)
- Refactored CombatTable to a new file
- Added PetAttackTable class (derivative of CombatTable, set to use pet stats and abilities)
- Couple of minor fixes to Pet Stats
- Fixed a bug where Bestial Wrath could cause Aspect of the Beast Uptime to go Infinite when you don't have the talent
- Some corrections to Crit Calcs
- Fixed a bug with Aspect of the Beast uptime during Bestial Wrath calculation (was doubling hunter DPS /facepalm)
- Fixed the damage adjustments to Volley (still need to add multiple target count)
- Added several talent's survivability values
- Fixed Aspect of the Hawk/DragonHawk AP bonus addage
- Fixed Pet Haste effect bonuses (had to add a recalculate after special effects in pet)
- Fixed a couple of survivability related talent values
- Changed Stat addage to Accumulate for better performance
- Added Longevity Cd reduc to Call of the Wild handling
- Did some work on the Intervals for Special Effects, integrating pet frequencies
- Fixed a bug with CombatTable for Pets
- Fixed Pet Spell Miss variable (didn't realize the Spell miss function in StatConversion was inverse)
- Removed some dead code
- Fixed a scope damage issue
- Fixed an issue with Focus Regen stats (at least I think I did)
- Improved Attack Intervals for Pet Special Effects
- Fix for Serpent Sting proc related damage
");
PNStuff.Add(
"v2.3.1 (Dec 10, 2009 03:47)",
@"- Corrected a couple of Get Stat points for Focus Recovery options
- Fixed a problem with Hunter's Hit translating to Pet's Dodged attacks
NOTICE: A new issue has been identified, if you do not select the option to use Aspect of the Viper but you are running out of Focus before end of fight, there's presently no penalty. I'll need to fix this but it's not a simple correction so please be patient and until then at least use Viper at 'Just Enough'
- Fixed some back end naming for Aspect of the Viper Usage
- Your DPS is now appropriately penalized when you are running OoM and not using an Aspect of the Viper Uptime, giving heavy favor to Focus Regen methods (pots, Mp5, etc). When using Viper, those stats reduce in value but don't go away unless your time to OoM is more than the fight duration
- Added a method by which users could get off the specialized chart setups after having viewed them. Since it doesn't auto-revert after seeing one of those and going back to a normal chart, you can now select one of the Custom DPS charts to revert the view then go to a normal chart.
- Added a new Custom Chart 'Pet Talents' looks and feels just like the regular talent chart but works on Pet Talents, even shows the information about the talent at it's current rank on mouse-over

- Changed T9 4P to use the stat itself instead of relying on the Buff Name
- Working with Pet Stats to ensure proper scaling
- More back end work
- Removed Avoidance talent from PetTalents, users may see their talents reset or look funky in next version but it shouldn't crash
- Fix for Issue 15240: Pet Talent Changes Cause Crash (was a talent indexing issue)

"v2.2.28 (Dec 06, 2009 22:28)",
@"- Fix for issue 14739: Optimize Requirement '% Chance to Miss' error (calcOpts wasn't being set before the call to it in the requirement, added set before call)
- Fix for bug with Hit Rating where more of it would hurt SpecialEffects
- Applied Patch 4398:
  * Adding tab to show shot rotation details
  * NOTE: This patch was applied but it presently doesn't have a function (it's just visual). Will add function later
- Fixed Strength stat from Gear pulling, also made it add to attack power like it should
- Added Profession Handling for Buffs, will auto-activate buff bonuses if you have the related Profession selected.
- Added Automated Buff Anti-Double-Dipping for Trueshot Aura. If you are maintaining it yourself, then it ignores the Buff version and uses your Talents instead. (This needs more verification)
- Fixed Crit Rating Procs so they will actually add to your Crit %
- Moved all references to the QuickShots effect to GetCharacterStats as a simple PhysicalHaste SpecialEffect (will add aspect downtime to it later)
- Moved all references to Call of the Wild to GetCharacterStats
- Moved all References to Trueshot Aura to GetCharacterStats
- Changed the RAP tooltip to just show base, agi, str bonuses (will add gear later)
- Fixed the activator that would turn off Buff version Trueshot aura when you have the talent yourself
- Added Hunter's Mark to Buff disabling when you have the relevant talents/glyphs (this still isn't working the way that I want)
- Moved Aspect of the Hawk and Dragonhawk's AP handling to GetCharacterStats
- Moved all references to Hunter vs Wild AP to GetCharacterStats
- Moved all references to Careful Aim AP to GetCharacterStats
- Fixed a Ranged Haste on Procs bug
- Redid hunter T8 4 pc to use a different trigger and method (and removed the old method stat placeholder from Stats)
- Moved all references to Expose Weakness AP to GetCharacterStats
- Moved all references to Furious Howl AP to GetCharacterStats
- Added a couple of files to begin work on converting shots to classes (will make them easier to manage and prevent some things from not affecting others)
- Fixed the Details tab resizing
- Aligned more of the back end for the new Ability system
- Started adding in shots using the Ability class method from DPSWarr (will not do any rotation work until all of this is settled first)
- Finally fixed the Buffs that Double-Dip. I had added the function that does the special handling but GetCharacterStats wasn't using it, D'OH!
- More shot data setups
- Moved TFB above OP in the priority queue, because OP's use is limited by TFB
- Corrected a bug in Arms where Slam would try to use more rage than you had available, which led to negative DPS while the rotation tried to correct itself
- All models using Prof enchant hiding have been changed to use the global sets on the Stats Pane and Options > General Settings > Hide enchants based on professions. Models that were handling this manually have been edited to the new method, models that didn't have it are now on it as the back end changed
- Profession bonus Buffs (Toughness and the like) are now updated when you update your professions in all models. Models that were handling this manually have been edited to the new method, models that didn't have it are now on it as the back end changed
- Added a new Stats for global Focus Cost Reducs by Percentage (for the Beast Within talent)
- Changed BonusDamageMultiplier usage in Hunter to not be restrictive (which was just dumb). It can now handle sources beyond just Buffs and be used in more places
- Changed handling of The Beast Within and Bestial Wrath. Now these are handled using SpecialEffects and better modifiers, though I do need to add more of it into Pet damage calculation. Also fixed teh Duration from 18 to 10 sec
- Changed the Armor Damage Reduction Formula for Pets to use the global one (just without ArP Rating)
- Added some Traps and Volley as selectable in your rotations (started out as a way to give value to several glyphs that were not being used and just kinda blew up from there)
- Fixed a bug I accidentally made with Armor Ignorance on Pets
- Removed the emulate Spreadsheet Bugs option
- Added a PTR Mode to enable 3.3 changes. Most affect stuff Hunter isn't set up to handle, but CullingTheHerd has been added to the Pet Talents so it can be selected

Completely reworked the Pet Talents storage and interface (these steps will lead towards storing Pet Specs alongside Hunter Specs and also makes it a lot easier for me to maintain)
- Interface on the options pane now looks more like the actual talent trees, though I still have some more tweaking to do
- Back end stores the talent info as a string, just like normal talents. Way better than the monstrously sized PetTalents section in the XML files before

- Added support for T10 2PC & 4PC, the values are in there but the uptimes are wrong, won't be correct until new rotation setup is created
- Fixed a couple missing relevant Triggers for Hunter Special Effects
- Removed Pot selection from Options Pane, migrating this to use Buff version of pots instead
- Added Nature Damage as a relevant stat

- Removed option to 'calculate uptimes like the spreadsheet' since the back end for it no longer exists
- Added Multiple Targets % to control Volley usage and reworked Volley's activation to enforce it's channeling
- Moved Traps to a separate section on the Stats Pane from Shots
- Removed Racials from the Stats Pane (back end is there)
- Adjusted the display of some of the Focus Regen stats
- Added the RAP boost coeff to Volley
- Added a failure reason to Volley for not having Multiple Targets active and at >0%
- Fixed a potential bug with certain gear setups that would break Focus Regen (causing it to go to Infinity)
- Made the Randomize Procs on Rotation Test option gray out if not using Shot Rotation Test
- Added the PetBuffSelector directly to the Options Pane instead of using a back end function to add it on load (previous builder didn't know how to add it)
- Moved Pet stuff to a subfolder

This module is designed for Hunters hoping to fulfill the DPS role in a raid, regardless of their specific spec (MM, BM, Surv).

To begin we assume you have already imported your character from either Rawr Addon or the Battle.net. If you would like to check your numbers against information from the next patch (at present, this is TBD) you can check that item.

... More to come, these instructions have to be rewritten for Rawr4";
            RTB_Advanced.Text = @"This section is for advanced users only, most players do not need to concern themselves with these settings.

Since you have gotten your feet wet, looked at your gear, maybe even run an optimization or two, now you must be hungry for more. Fear not, there's plenty more you can tweak with your character.

The Boss Handler Tab

We will be adding functionality to maintain damage taken, for survivability and for the additional rage generated from damage taken at some point, but time takes time.

The Situational Boxes on The Fight Info Tab

This tab holds information regarding how often in a fight your toon is in that particular situation. Presently, there are five options with individual settings for each:
- Standing in Back: You spend at least x% of the fight standing behind the target. Mobs are unable to parry or block attacks from behind so the ~13% of attacks that could normally be parried are no longer on the table. If you are not standing behind the mob during for any portion of the fight, Expertise will have additional value due to it preventing Parries.
- Multiple Targets: Your encounter has additional mobs within melee striking distance for x% amount of time. This provides usefulness for abilities such as Cleave, Bladestorm, Whirlwind, Sweeping Strikes to start 'doing their thing' and allowing you to hit the additional targets for a greater overall DPS. Boss fights like Patchwerk however, do not have additional targets. There is a cap for the number of targets placed so that abilities such as Whirlwind do not go for 4 targets worth of damage when there are only 2 targets.
- Moving Targets: Your encounter has a target that moves out of melee striking distance for x% amount of time. This provides usefulness for abilities such as Charge and Intercept and talents which enable these abilities. This also provides effectiveness for Move Speed Enchants like Cat's Swiftness. A good example of this situation is 'Archavon the Stone Watcher' in the 'Vault of Archavon (VoA)'. [Currently this functionality is only active for Arms, not Fury, Charge, etc abilities are not yet modeled]
- Stunning Targets: Your encounter has a target that either stuns just yourself or your entire raid  x times over the fight duration for y milliseconds (1000 = 1 second). This provides usefulness for abilities such as Every man for Himself (Humans) and the talent Iron Will. You can change the values of both boxes by changing one of them. E.g.- Set Percentage to 25% and it will change the seconds box to match and vice-versa. [Currently this functionality is only active for Arms, not Fury]
- Disarming Targets: Your encounter has a target that disarms your characters' weapon periodically in combat. This provides usefulness for things like Titanium Weapon Chain and the talent Weapon Mastery. Most bosses do not do this, but there are several groups of trash (namely in Karazhan) that will disarm players. [Currently, this functionality has not been implemented, though it will be coming soon.]
Additional Situations to manage will be coming soon.

The Ability Maintenance Tab

Select additional abilities to watch how they affect your DPS. Thunder Clap applies a debuff to bosses as do Sunder Armor, Demoralizing Shout, Shattering Throw, etc.";
